## What is cloud computing?
- delivery of databases, storages, applications and others..
- pay as you go pricing (get charged for the amount used)


## How do we know something is running in the cloud?
- service delivered over the internet
- available on demand
- centrally managed


## Models of cloud deployment

### 1. Public cloud: 
- used by or shared with the public
- has multi tenants
- owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider
- delivered over the internet
  
### 2. Private cloud: 
- single tenant cloud, just has 1 occupant (the organisation that sets it up)
- dedicated to a private organisation 
- could be used when there is no internet (e.g. on a cruise ship)
- advantages 
  - not exposed to the public
  - complete control

### 3. Hybrid cloud:
- mix of on premises and public cloud usually (database held on premises, the application hosted on public cloud)

### 4. Multi-cloud: 
- uses more than 1 cloud provider to maintain the database and application

## Types of cloud services: Iaas, Paas, SaaS

### Infrastructure as a Service (Virtual Machine)
Controls and is responsible for:
- Virtualisation
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### Platform as a Service (App Service)
Controls and is responsible for:
- Runtime
- Middleware
- O/S
- Virtualisation
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### Software as a Service (Salesforce, Office 365)
Controls and is responsible for:
- Applications
- Runtime
- Middleware
- O/S
- Virtualisation
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

## Adv/DisAdv of the cloud
Adv
- information security team
  
DisAdv
- high energy costs

## OpEx vs CapEx
OpEx: Operational Expenditure
- pay monthly
- usually how you pay for cloud servicecs
  
CapEx: Capital Expenditure
- pay up front
- usually more capex with on-premises

## Is the cloud always cheaper
Total Cost of Ownership Calculator (TOC)
- calculates if the cost of using cloud services is better than running it on premises

## Guaranteed levels of service
SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- Guarantee to provide you as a customer a level of service, if the agreement is not reached, you may be entitled to some money back (e.g 99.999% uptime)

SLO (Service Level Objective)
- 99.9999% covers themselves so that they do not break the service level agreement and have to give money back to the customers

## Marketshare
The big three
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloup Platform
- Azure by Microsoft

## which cloud provider is best
There are advantages and dis

## What are you paying for when using the cloud
- use of computer power and RAM
- use of storage space
- create traffic(having virtual machines talking to each from different regions, locations)
  - "egress" if going out of the network
- things in limited supply e.g. public ip address
